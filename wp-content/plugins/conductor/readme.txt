Introduction
------------
Thank you for using The Conductor plugin.

Conductor was born from a need that we discovered within our custom WordPress work at Slocum Studio.
While building content rich sites for our clients, the desire to customize a theme’s display of
content was a common request.

From site to site, we were building a use case for an easy-to-use plugin that produced a user
friendly widget. Something that was powerful enough for developers, but easy enough for the
common author or editor to manipulate.

The best use of WordPress is for publishing content. However, most WordPress themes display content
using the same stale display. Out of the box, WordPress doesn’t allow us to curate unique collections
of our content to put on display for our visitors.

Conductor changes all of that.

Leverage Conductor to make custom homepage layouts for your content or to make each category archive
distinct from the other. This translates to a better visitor experience, more content consumption,
and the power to promote your content the way you want to.

Slocum Studio is very proud of Conductor and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoy producing it.
